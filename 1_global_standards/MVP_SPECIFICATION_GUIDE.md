Perfect — this is an essential piece of your meta-framework’s developer onboarding.
Below is a **complete documentation file** that you can drop into your repo at:

```
/1_global_standards/MVP_SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
```

It explains *why* the file exists, *how* it’s structured, *validation rules*, and *common pitfalls* when authoring a new `MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml`.
The format is consistent with your L2.5 meta-framework conventions and readable by both humans and AI (Cursor agent).

---

# 🧭 MVP_SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

**Title:** Authoring and Maintaining `MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml`
**Version:** 1.0
**Audience:** Developers, Architects, AI Agents (Cursor)
**Purpose:** Define and standardize how new projects describe themselves for initialization under the L2.5 meta-framework.

---

## 🧠 What is `MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml`?

The `MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml` file is the **single source of truth** for describing how an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) should be initialized, scaffolded, and executed by the meta-framework.
It is a declarative blueprint that the **initializer (human or AI)** reads to generate:

* The project folder structure
* Tech stack and dependencies
* Environment configuration
* Active build plan (`ACTIVE_PLAN.yaml`)
* Sandbox permissions and validation checks

Think of it as the “genetic code” of the project — everything else (CI, folders, tasks, code scaffolds) is *derived from it*.

---

## 📦 File Location

Always place the file in:

```
/0_phase0_bootstrap/MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml
```

This ensures that:

* The `project_initializer` can auto-detect it during `ai-dev init`.
* Schema validation (`/7_schemas/mvp_spec.schema.json`) runs automatically.
* AI sandbox rules treat it as **read-only**.

---

## ⚙️ Validation and Enforcement

* The spec is validated against `/7_schemas/mvp_spec.schema.json` on every initialization.
* The pre-commit hook and `schema_enforcement.py` block commits if invalid.
* It must include all **core sections** and follow the correct key hierarchy.

## 🧱 1. Header Fields (Required)

```yaml
Project: My Awesome MVP
Maturity: L2.5
Architecture: Single Vercel App with App Router

        lib/
        public/
  scripts:
    - new-funnel.ts

## 🧠 Best Practices

| Principle               | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Declarative only**    | No imperative instructions or shell commands in YAML.                |
| **Portable**            | Avoid absolute paths. Use relative repo paths only.                  |
| **Readable**            | Keep key names lowercase or snake_case.                              |
| **Schema-aligned**      | Validate against `/7_schemas/mvp_spec.schema.json` before commit.    |
| **Immutable post-init** | Do not modify after `ai-dev init`. Changes require new spec version. |

## 🧱 Common Mistakes

| Mistake                               | Result                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Missing `ACTIVE_PLAN_TEMPLATE`        | Initializer can’t create `ACTIVE_PLAN.yaml`. |
| Invalid YAML indentation              | Parsing errors during initialization.        |
| Missing keys under `TECH_STACK`       | Dependency installer fails.                  |
| Changing meta-framework paths         | AI sandbox rejects plan.                     |
| Setting `modify_meta_framework: true` | Disables safety in L2.5.                     |

---

## ✅ Validation Command

Once written, run:

```bash
python3 3_bootstrap_scripts/schema_enforcement.py --file 0_phase0_bootstrap/MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml
```

---

## 📜 Versioning

* Each major update to the MVP spec should increment a version comment at the top.
* Keep previous versions archived under `/docs/archive/mvp_specs/`.
